            The ceremony (depending on weather) is intended to be held outside and the reception will follow inside. Ladies, hats are very welcome but this is entirely up to you. 
        </p> 
        </p>Above all be comfortable and have fun.

        <p>
        We realise many of you have little ones, unfortunately however, we are unable to accomodate children at the ceremony and reception other than those who are in the bridal party.
