        It all started with an eggplant (aubergine for UK translation) when Joe approached me in a London bar and literally gave me an eggplant. Following my initial confusion with his chat-up line, we got chatting, drinking and dancing. Despite giving him the wrong phone number, we eventually met up through a friend of mine who had the foresight to give him the right number!

  A year and a half later and after plenty of partying and a bit of working in London, adventures in Europe and trips back and forth to America,  Joe proposed on 17 May 2013. A beautiful diamond ring was produced from a remote control car, on bended knee. It was perfect and very Joe. We began the Visa process and a few months later Joe was offered a job in Philadelphia, so we packed up our belongings and Ralph the cat and moved to the USA on 24 July 2013.
